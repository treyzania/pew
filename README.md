#Pew

Pew is a game I wrote/am writing in Unity3D, soon to be available on the Google
Play Store.  It is largely standalone and shouldn't require anything special to
build it.

If you want to redistrubite it, go ahead.  But do as the license asks and don't
claim it as your own, sell it, or redistribute it under an incompatible
license.
