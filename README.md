#Pew

Pew is a game I wrote/am writing in Unity3D, [available on the Google
Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.treyzania.pew).
It is largely standalone and shouldn't require anything special to build it.

If you want to redistrubite it, go ahead.  But do as the license asks and don't
claim it as your own, sell it, or redistribute it under an incompatible
license.

Support for iOS may come in the future.  IF you would like to contribute this
or anything else, feel free.
